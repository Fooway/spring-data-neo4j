The first part of the book provides a tutorial that walks through the creation of a complete web application
called cineasts.net, built with Spring Data Neo4j. Cineasts are people who love movies, and the site is a gathering place
for moviegoers. For cineasts.net we decided to add a social aspect to the rating of movies, allowing friends to share
their scores and get recommendations for new friends and movies.

The tutorial takes the reader through the steps necessary to create the application. It provides the configuration and
code examples that are needed to understand what's happening in Spring Data Neo4j. The complete source code for the app
is available on http://spring.neo4j.org/cineasts[Github].
